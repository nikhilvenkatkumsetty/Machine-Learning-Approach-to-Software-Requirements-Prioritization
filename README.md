# Machine-Learning-Approach-to-software-requirements-Prioritization
Using Genetic Algorithm and Particle- swarm optimization to prioritize the software requirements of a project
## Description:
Requirement analysts possess relevant knowledge about the
relative importance of requirements. We use an Interactive
Genetic Algorithm to produce a requirement ordering which
complies with the existing priorities, satisfies the technical
constraints and takes into account the relative preferences
elicited from the user. On a real case study, we show that
this approach improves non interactive optimization, ignoring
the elicited preferences, and that it can handle a number of
requirements which is otherwise problematic for state of the
art techniques.
