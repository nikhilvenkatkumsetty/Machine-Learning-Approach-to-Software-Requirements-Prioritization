# Machine-Learning-Approach-to-software-requirements-Prioritization
Using Genetic Algorithm and Particle- swarm optimization to prioritize the software requirements of a project
## Description:
Requirement analysts possess relevant knowledge about the relative importance of requirements. We use an Interactive Genetic Algorithm to produce a requirement ordering which
complies with the existing priorities, satisfies the technical constraints and takes into account the relative preferences elicited from the user. On a real case study, we show that this approach improves non interactive optimization, ignoring the elicited preferences, and that it can handle a number of requirements which is otherwise problematic for state of the art techniques.
